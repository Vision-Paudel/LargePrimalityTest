# PrimalityTest
Test for prime numbers.
-------------------------------
It can test for prime number up to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. (1 Quintillion)
I have tried to make it efficient. It tests for large numbers within 30 seconds or less.

| Include            | Console       | GUI   |
| ------------------ |:-------------:| -----:|
| Source file(s)     | right-aligned | $1600 |
| Binary File(s)     | centered      |   $12 |
| Runnable Jar File  | are neat      |    $1 |
